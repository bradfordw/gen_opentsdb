gen_opentsdb is a gen_server which connects and is able to push (and soon be able to query) metrics to an opentsdb server.

Example usage:

  gen_opentsdb:start_link().
  
  gen_opentsdb:put_metric(<<"nhl.det">>,150.0).
  %% Submits a metric "nhl.det" with a value of 150.0 and no tags.
  
  gen_opentsdb:put_metric(<<"nhl.det">>,150.0,[{<<"user">>,<<"brad">>}])
  %% Submits the same metric as before, but with a proplist which will be composed into a tag key/value pair for opentsdb.
